            <p> The goal of the
                project was to implement, through the combination of the programming languages python
                and solidity, the process of NFT realization and minting automatism on Polygon test network.
                As a result, a collection of 500 unique images were obtained, which through the automatic
                of minting, were made an NFT collection, a collection visible on the openSea platform.</p>
